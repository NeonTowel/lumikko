> "Don't Panic!" — The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and also this repo)

Welcome to **Lumikko** — the intergalactic hitchhiker's guide to not leaking your company's secrets in code. This project is so easy to use, even a Vogon could do it (but please, no poetry). 🪐

## What's in the Box? 📦

- **`/ui`** — The shiny frontend. Paste your code, press a button, and watch as your secrets are whisked away faster than you can say "Infinite Improbability Drive." Built with SvelteKit, Tailwind, and a healthy disregard for hardcoded credentials.
- **`/api`** — The backend. Powered by Hono and Cloudflare Workers, it talks to AI so you don't have to. It sanitizes your code, gives recommendations, and never asks for a towel.
- **`mock-bad-code.go`** — A cautionary tale. If you find yourself writing code like this, please consult your nearest pan-galactic developer.
- **`mock-api-response.json`** — What happens when you let the AI do its thing. Spoiler: your password is now `********`.

## How Do I Use This Thing? 🤔

1. Clone the repo. (Don't forget your towel.)
2. See `/ui/README.md` to run the frontend. See `/api/README.md` to run the backend. Or just stare at the code and contemplate life, the universe, and everything.
3. Paste your code in the UI. Get sanitized code and recommendations. Avoid embarrassment at your next code review.

## Why Does This Exist? 🌌

Because hardcoding secrets is the third most embarrassing thing you can do in public (the first two involve karaoke and a Babel fish). Lumikko helps you keep your code clean, your secrets secret, and your sense of humor intact.
